Things communicate with messages.\\
Things fail."\\

** "The Free Lunch Is Over" Conclusion
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"If you haven’t done so already, *now is the time to take a hard look at the design of your application, determine what operations are CPU-sensitive* now or are likely to become so soon, *and identify how those places could benefit from concurrency*.\\
Now is also the time for you and *your team to grok concurrent programming*'s requirements, pitfalls, styles, and idioms." -- Herb Sutter (2005)

** New Concurrent Programming Languages
- Clojure :: 2007 [STM, agents, CSP] (Java, CLR)
- Go :: 2009 [CSP] (Python, C++)
- Elixir ::  2010 [Actors] (Ruby)
** Languages/Frameworks with Actors libraries
- Erlang/Elixir :: -
- Scala :: Akka
- NET :: Orleans
- Ruby :: Cellulloid
- Python :: Pulsar 
* Actor Model
** Carl Hewitt (1973)
Actor Model is a conceptual model to deal with concurrent computation.
** Actor
- An actor is the *fundamental unit of computation*.
- Internal State.
- It can do only one of thse 3 things:
  1. create some more actors
  2. send messages
  3. designate how to handle the next message it will receive
** "One Ant is no Ant"
Actors come in "systems". To distinguish between them, they need an address.

** Message Passing
- Messages are sent asynchronously
- Message order is not guaranteed
- Best effort to receive a message
- A message will be delivered at most once
- There is no intermediary
* Concurrency in Elixir
** Actor = Process
- Very lightweight compared to OS threads and processes.
- Processes share no memory.
#+INCLUDE: "src/slides/process_sum.exs" src elixir
** Actor Example
#+INCLUDE: "src/slides/process_counter.exs" src elixir
** Message = Term
#+INCLUDE: "src/slides/terms.exs" src elixir
** Message Passing
- Asynchronous (non-blocking)
- Data Copy
- Causal Ordering
#+INCLUDE: "src/slides/message_passing.exs" src elixir
* Demo
** Counter
** Chat Server
** Distributed Chat Server
* Recap
- "The free lunch is over", we have to start designing with concurrency in mind.
- Actor Model models concurrency with message passing between independent actors.
- Erlang/Elixir implements Actor Model to build massively concurrent, fault-tolerant, scalable systems.

* Food For Thought
- OTP :: set of Erlang libraries to module concurrent processes well.
- Riak Core :: Library to build Distributed Systems in Erlang
- Phoenix :: Elixir Web Server ala "Ruby on Rails"
- Nerves :: Framework to build projects in embedded systems with Elixir
* Q&A
* Thanks!
